# New joke language

## 2022 Friday June 17th

Thought of on 2022 Wednesday, June 15th, published on 2022, Friday, June 17th.

A "Smurfy" variant of each language, which replaces certain words and grammar patterns to match the theme of the Smurfs media franchise.

Example:

`English (Smurfy)`

| English | English (Smurfy) |
|---|---|
| What a lovely fantastic day! | What a smurfy smurfastic day! |

(Please suggest better examples)
