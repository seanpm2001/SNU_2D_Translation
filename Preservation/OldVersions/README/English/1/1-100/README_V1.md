# Preservation of language

This project aims to preserve the complete structure of every spoken language, dialect, and sublanguage that is recoverable or archivable. Most of the common ones have already been listed. There are plans to support over 1000 different languages.

## Preservation levels

These are the preservation levels I use.

### No concern A

Languages with 100 million or more speakers

### No concern B

Languages with 30 million or more speakers

### Preserve for future use

Languages with 15-30 million or more speakers

### Needs to be preserved

Languages with 15-10 million speakers

### Becoming endangered

Languages with 6-10 million speakers

### Endangered

Languages with 3-6 million speakers

### Highly endangered

Languages with 250,000 to 3 million speakers

### Critically endangered

Languages with 70,000 to 249,999 speakers

### Highest priority, extremely critically endangered

Languages with less than 70000 speakers.

### Persecuted

Languages of a people that are currently being persecuted or killed off, 2nd highest priority, although both categories can be worked on at the same time.
