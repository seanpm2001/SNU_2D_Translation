# Piglatin support pack library

**This software library is for:** `//SNU/SNU_2D_Translation`

## Purpose

The purpose of the Pig latin (igpay atinlay) support pack software library is for supporting the joke translation system of word reversal to match that of the pig latin argot language.

Example from [en.wikipedia.org - The English Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pig_Latin)

### Background

For words that begin with consonant sounds, all letters before the initial vowel are placed at the end of the word sequence. Then, "ay" is added, as in the following examples:

    "pig" = "igpay"
    "latin" = "atinlay"
    "banana" = "ananabay"
    "will" = "illway"
    "butler" = "utlerbay"
    "happy" = "appyhay"
    "duck" = "uckday"
    "me" = "emay"
    "bagel" = "agelbay"

When words begin with consonant clusters (multiple consonants that form one sound), the whole sound is added to the end when speaking or writing.

    "smile" = "ilesmay"
    "string" = "ingstray"
    "stupid" = "upidstay"
    "glove" = "oveglay"
    "trash" = "ashtray"
    "floor"= "oorflay"
    "store"= "orestay"

For words that begin with vowel sounds, the vowel is left alone, and most commonly 'yay' is added to the end. But in different parts of the world, there are different 'dialects' of sorts. Some people may add 'way' or 'hay' or other endings. Examples are:

    "eat" = "eatyay" or "eatay"
    "omelet" = "omeletyay" or "omeletay"
    "are" = "areyay" or "areay"
    "egg" = "eggyay" or "eggay"
    "explain" = "explainyay"
    "always" = "alwaysyay" or "alwaysay"
    "ends" = "endsyay" or "endsay"
    "honest" = "honestyay"
    "I"= "Iyay"

An alternative convention for words beginning with vowel sounds, one removes the initial vowel(s) along with the first consonant or consonant cluster. This usually only works for words with more than one syllable and offers a variant of the words in keeping with the mysterious, unrecognizable sounds of the converted words. Examples are:

    "every" = "eryevay"
    "another" = "otheranay"
    "under" = "erunday"
    "island" = "andislay"
    "elegant" = "egantelay"

Sentence structure remains the same as it would in English. Pronunciation of some words may be a little difficult for beginners, but people can easily understand Pig Latin with practice.
