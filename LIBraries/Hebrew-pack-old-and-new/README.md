# Hebrew language pack (old and new) library

**This software library is for:** `//SNU/SNU_2D_Translation`

## Purpose

The purpose of the Hebrew language pack (old and new) is for supporting the reading and translation of the Hebrew language and its dialects (such as Ancient Hebrew, Hebrew, Yiddish, etc.)

Another pack (Languages-of-the-Ancient-World-pack) may have a conflict if this pack is not programmed correctly.
