# Rosetta Stone tour library

**This software library is for:** `//SNU/SNU_2D_Translation`

## Purpose

The Rosetta Stone tour software library is for creating a virtual Rosetta Stone, at full quality, with all the original translations (in the 3 Ancient languages used)

Currently, I don't have a high enough scan of the Rosetta Stone, so a sample image with low quality is all that is available for now.
